### Given an unordered array and the information that exactly one value in the array occurs twice (every other value occurs exactly once), how would you determine which value occurs twice? Write a method that will find and return the duplicate value that is known to be in the array. ###

# Input:
# - An unordered array of integers

# Output:
# - A single integer that is the value in the array that occurs twice

# EXAMPLES:
# find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1
# find_dup([18,  9, 36, 96, 31, 19, 54, 75, 42, 15,
#           38, 25, 97, 92, 46, 69, 91, 59, 53, 27,
#           14, 61, 90, 81,  8, 63, 95, 99, 30, 65,
#           78, 76, 48, 16, 93, 77, 52, 49, 37, 29,
#           89, 10, 84,  1, 47, 68, 12, 33, 86, 60,
#           41, 44, 83, 35, 94, 73, 98,  3, 64, 82,
#           55, 79, 80, 21, 39, 72, 13, 50,  6, 70,
#           85, 87, 51, 17, 66, 20, 28, 26,  2, 22,
#           40, 23, 71, 62, 73, 32, 43, 24,  4, 56,
#           7,  34, 57, 74, 45, 11, 88, 67,  5, 58]) == 73

# ALGORITHM:
# - Initialize checker array
# - Initialize index counter
# - Loop through array
#   - Push arr[index] into empty array
#   - Increment the index += 1
#   - Break if arr[index] is equal to the last element pushed into the checker array
# - Return the last element of the checker array

def find_dup(arr)
  check_arr = []
  idx = 0
  until check_arr.any?(arr[idx])
    check_arr << arr[idx]
    idx += 1
  end
  arr[idx]
end

# OR

def find_dup2(arr)
  arr.find { |element| arr.count(element) == 2 }
end
